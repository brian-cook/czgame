# Current Project Issues Checklist

## 1. Autoload Configuration [ðŸŸ¥ CRITICAL]
- [ ] Fix malformed autoload entry in project.godot:
    Change from: "#Addautoloadshereifneeded[_global_script_class_icons]PlayerState"
    To: "GlobalPlayerState="*res://src/scripts/player/states/player_state.gd""
    Note: Renamed to avoid conflict with PlayerState class
- [ ] Properly register state machine autoloads
- [ ] Add missing EffectManager autoload
- [ ] Review and clean up unused autoloads

## 2. Scene References [ðŸŸ¨ IMPORTANT]
- [ ] Add proper UIDs to scene references using Godot 4.3's built-in UUID system
- [ ] Verify all scene paths are correct using absolute paths
- [ ] Document scene dependencies in a dependency graph
- [ ] Implement scene validation system using ResourceLoader

## 3. Collision System [ðŸŸ¨ IMPORTANT]
- [ ] Review and document collision layers using Godot 4.3's layer naming:
    - Layer 1: Player (1)
    - Layer 4: Projectile (4)
    - Layer 8: Enemy (8)
    - Layer 16: Resource (16)
- [ ] Create collision matrix documentation
- [ ] Implement consistent collision masks
- [ ] Add collision debug visualization using Debug > Visible Collision Shapes

## 4. State Machine Issues [ðŸŸ¨ IMPORTANT]
- [ ] Fix potential race conditions in transitions using proper signal connections
- [ ] Implement proper transition queueing with defer
- [ ] Add state transition validation
- [ ] Improve state machine debugging with Debug > Remote Scene Tree
- [ ] Document state machine architecture

## 5. Object Pool Management [ðŸŸ¨ IMPORTANT]
- [ ] Review cleanup logic using queue_free()
- [ ] Implement proper synchronization using SceneTree
- [ ] Add pool statistics tracking
- [ ] Implement memory usage monitoring using Performance singleton
- [ ] Document pool configuration

## 6. Missing Infrastructure [ðŸŸ¦ SETUP]
- [ ] Create directory structure:
    /src/
      /scenes/
        /effects/
      /scripts/
        /effects/
      /resources/
        /effects/
- [ ] Setup base effect classes
- [ ] Implement effect pooling system

## 7. Debug Systems [ðŸŸ¦ SETUP]
- [ ] Add visual debugging tools using CanvasLayer
- [ ] Implement logging system with print_debug()
- [ ] Create performance monitoring using Performance singleton
- [ ] Add state visualization
- [ ] Setup debug console

## Priority Levels:
ðŸŸ¥ CRITICAL: Blocking issues that need immediate attention
ðŸŸ¨ IMPORTANT: Should be fixed before new feature implementation
ðŸŸ¦ SETUP: Required for proper project structure
â¬œ MINOR: Quality of life improvements

## Notes:
- Issues marked CRITICAL should be addressed before implementing new features
- IMPORTANT issues may impact stability and performance
- SETUP issues are required for proper project organization
- Document all changes in the project changelog
- All implementations should follow Godot 4.3 best practices

## Next Steps:
1. Fix autoload configuration in Project Settings
2. Setup proper directory structure following /src organization
3. Implement collision system documentation with proper layer setup
4. Review and fix state machine issues using proper signal connections
5. Improve object pool management with Performance monitoring
