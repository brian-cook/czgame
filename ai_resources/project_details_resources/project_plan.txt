# Project Plan: CZ Game - Survival Action with Comfort Zones

## 1. Core Game Mechanics
### Player Systems
- Basic movement (WASD/Arrow keys)
- Auto-attacking system
- Health/Resource management
- Experience/Leveling system
- Inventory/Equipment system
- Quick restart option (from market research)
- Build preview system

### Combat Systems
- Weapon types and behaviors
- Damage calculation
- Collision detection
- Attack patterns
- Area effects
- Clear visual feedback for attacks
- Damage numbers display
- Screen shake and hit feedback

### Comfort Zone Mechanics
- Safe zone definition and visualization
- Resource denial in safe zones
- Player invisibility to AI while in zones
- Transition effects entering/leaving zones
- Zone placement strategies
- Zone interaction with enemies
- AI pathfinding ignores players in comfort zones
- No enemy stacking/clustering around zones
- Zone upgrades and variations
- Strategic zone placement mechanics

## 2. Progression Systems
### Character Development
- Experience points
- Level-up system
- Skill trees
- Attribute points
- Permanent upgrades (meta-progression)
- Multiple viable build paths
- Clear stat information display

### Equipment & Resources
- Weapon types and variations
- Armor/Defense items
- Consumables
- Currency system
- Resource gathering
- Item synergies
- Build variety
- Clear upgrade effects

### Unlockables
- New character types with unique playstyles
- Additional weapon options
- Alternative builds
- Special abilities
- Challenge modes
- Daily runs

## 3. Enemy Systems
### Enemy Types
- Basic enemies (fast/weak)
- Tank enemies (slow/strong)
- Ranged enemies
- Special/Elite enemies
- Boss encounters
- Distinct visual designs
- Clear attack patterns

### Spawn Systems
- Wave management with object pooling
- Difficulty scaling
- Spawn patterns
- Enemy density control
- Zone-based spawning
- AI awareness system for comfort zones
- Distance-based update frequencies
- Group behavior optimization

## 4. Technical Architecture
### Core Systems
- GameManager (singleton)
- EventBus for decoupled communication
- ResourceManager with pooling
- SaveManager
- InputManager
- ComfortZoneManager
- PerformanceMonitor
- EffectManager

### Data Management
- Enemy data
- Weapon data
- Player stats
- Level configuration
- Progress tracking
- Zone configuration data
- Build statistics
- Achievement tracking

### Performance Optimization
- Object pooling for enemies and effects
- Spatial partitioning (QuadTree)
- LOD system for distant entities
- Culling strategies
- Zone visibility optimization
- Sprite batching
- Update frequency management
- Memory optimization
